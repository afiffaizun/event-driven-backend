# ADR 003: At-Least-Once Message Delivery

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Message loss is unacceptable for business-critical events,
but exactly-once delivery adds significant complexity.

## Decision
Use at-least-once delivery with idempotent consumers.

## Rationale
- Simpler implementation
- Better reliability
- Industry-proven pattern

## Consequences
- Consumers must handle duplicate messages
- Requires idempotency keys
